# Enterprise Knowledge Mining Solution using the Microsoft AI Platform
### Build an enterprise scale intelligent search solution for searching business documents using Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Search

#### About this Course
In this course, you will learn to build an enterprise search solution by applying knowledge mining approach to search an organization’s business documents like Microsoft Office, PDFs and images using Azure search and Cognitive search skillsets and expose the results via a Bot interface.

You will learn to perform entity recognition, image analysis, text translation and indexed search on enterprise business documents using Microsoft Cognitive Services and Azure Search. This approach can be used with almost any Azure service to augment a customer’s scenario involving intelligent search. 

While this course focusses on Azure and Cognitive search capabilities, a depth course on building Bots and integrating various cognitive services is available here - [Building Intelligent Agents and Apps](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-Bootcamp/emergingaidev_bootcamp).

In this course you will learn

-- Fundamentals of Azure Search and its capabilities.

-- Understand Microsoft Cognitive Search and its key scenarios for using them.

-- Build an enriched data pipeline for search using predefined and custom skillsets:

    -- Text skills like entity recognition, language detection, text manipulation and key phrase extraction.
    
    -- Image skills like OCR.
    
    -- Language skills like text translation.
    
    -- Content moderation skills to block documents with incompliant content.
    
-- Use the enriched data pipeline for a knowledge mining solution on business documents within an enterprise.

-- Expose the knowledge mining solution using a bot interface for document search and consumption.
